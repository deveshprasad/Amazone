# Amazone

Task is to design, implement and demonstrate a NoSQL database for the
Amazone online shopping website that operates only in the UK. 


## Case Background
Amazone has decided to expand its operations by delivering fresh groceries. To offer
same-day and instant grocery delivery service, the company has partnered with a UK
groceries retailer, Morrison. This partnership will enable Amazone to do fresh and
same-day grocery delivery. Amazone has decided to experiment with same-day and
instant grocery delivery using Manchester. Six Morrison grocery stores have been
chosen for instant pick-up and delivery by delivery drivers who are Amazon partners.

The Amazone team has contacted your team to develop a new online platform that
accommodates both the existing and new business models. Your team has been
provided with the following information to help with the data modelling and
implementation service.
